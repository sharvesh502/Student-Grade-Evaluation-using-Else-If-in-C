# Student-Grade-Evaluation-using-Else-If-in-C
This mini project takes a student's marks as input and evaluates their grade based on standard grading criteria. It uses basic conditional logic with if, else if, and else statements. The program also handles invalid inputs like marks above 100 or below 0, without using logical operators like ||, staying within beginner-level syntax boundaries.
